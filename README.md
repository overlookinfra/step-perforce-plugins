# Step Perforce Plugins

This repo contains plugins for [step-cli](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/) that are designed to simplify and automate processes here at Perforce.

These are written for internal use, but may provide inspiration for others. Do note that many assumptions are made within the plugins based on our setup... use at your own risk.

## Usage

The installation process below will take care of both initial installations and updating existing installations.

### On Linux and macOS

./install.sh
```

### On Windows

Windows plugins will be coming soon...
